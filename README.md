## ðŸ¤– Fraud Detection System with Multiple Machine Learning Models
This project is a fraud detection system that utilizes various machine learning models to predict fraud. The system processes data to predict whether an insurance claim is fraudulent or not, leveraging different algorithms and offering a dynamic selection of models.

## âœ… Purpose of This System
The main goal of this project is to offer a flexible and dynamic fraud detection solution that can:

Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models for fraud detection.

Predict fraud in new data and provide actionable results.

Allow users to easily switch between different models to find the best performing one.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works
**Data Preparation**: The system takes in a dataset of historical insurance claims (Seguros.csv), with a column indicating whether the claim was fraudulent or not.

**Model Training**: The user selects a model (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.), and the system trains that model using the data.

**Model Evaluation**: After training, the system provides performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) to evaluate how well the model performs on the test data.

**Prediction on New Data**: The trained model can then be used to predict fraud for new data (SegurosNuevos.csv), and the results are saved to an output file (SegurosML_Predict.csv).
